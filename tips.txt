* Intro * (30s)
	- If you have used brewster...

* Why SMGridView? * (1:00 - 1:30)
- Custom
	- We tried other open source libraries, but none of them satisfied us, performance and functionality were not optimal. 
	- Then we tried UITableView
	
- UITableView
	- You need to add subviews inside a cell (annoying)
	- Is only rows (not suitable for delete, move...)
	- Is only vertical

- UICollectionView
	- This was not available when we started developing.
	- Only ios6
	- It is more complex to implement for a simple grid. 
	
* Features * (1:30)
100 items
90 size
3 sections
Vertical
No loader
No pagination
Sort wait time 0
Headers (non sticky)
	
	- Vertical Horizontal
	- UITableViewCell not subview: use your own views
	- Sections: like UITableView

	- Pagination: Reverse ordering. Page changes notifier.
	- Empty View: just set 0 items.
	
* How to use it? *
- Similar to UITableView. 
- 3 required in dataSource
	- number of items in a section
	- size of each item, to calculate positions and the views and contentSize of the scroll area
	- the view: views are going to be asked when needed, and you should REUSE (dequeue)
	
- ReloadData: is calling your dataSource methods to learn about the positions of the views
- Reuse: you can call with class (as we don't use a specific view type, we don't have ID's like UITableViews)
